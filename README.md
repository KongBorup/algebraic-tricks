# The Handy Dandy Book of Algebraic Tricks
This is a collection og algebraic tricks that I have found useful. The purpose
of this book is to be a tool, which makes rewriting algebraic expressions
simpler.

## TODOs
- [ ] Add rules for logarithms with different bases.
- [ ] Make live HTML demo (hosted with GitHub Pages).
- [ ] Make the table in the *Differentials* section repeat to the side before going to a new page.
